App for required functions

## Get it running

recommended to use VSCode and you will have to setup the flutter developent environment as per:
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install

You can also message me via the usual channels and I will literally come on a zoom meeting and get you ready for developing. Try trello if you can't get me elsewhere.

After this, run
`flutter pub get`

and launch/debug app the usual way from VSCode.
